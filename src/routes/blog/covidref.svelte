Legislative change

We are currently in discussion with the Department of Health and Social Care to underpin this statement with emergency legal powers that:

allow fitness to practise notices to be served by email;
clarify that hearing ‘venue’ includes audio and/or video-conferencing details; and
enable the Hearings Manager to postpone or adjourn hearings.
We also believe that further powers relating to the size and composition of fitness to practise committees for substantive hearings are required on a permanent basis to be able to effectively deal with emergencies. This would align us with other healthcare regulators, including the General Medical Council (GMC) and Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), by having the option to convene fitness to practise committees of not less than three members with a quorum of two members (one lay and one registrant) for substantive hearings.
The Department of Health and Social Care has been in discussion with us about securing these powers as part of emergency legislation.
We are interested to understand any impacts that may result from obtaining and implementing these powers.

Section 2.8: Verification of contact lens specifications
Purpose:
This statement relaxes enforcement of our legislation and allows a registrant to supply contact lenses without verification of the contact lens specification during the COVID-19 emergency where attempts to verify have not been successful and they have used their professional judgement.
Link to document:
GOC/COVID/09 https://www.optical.org/filemanager/root/site_assets/publications/covid_19/statement_on_verification_of_contact_lens_specifications_during_covid-19_emergency_final_200709_new_review_date.pdf
Categorisation:
  Red
Rationale:
We propose that subject to the outcome of this consultation, this statement will apply in the red phase of the pandemic only. This is because it is linked to accessibility of information from optical practices, which may not be available during the red phase. Our understanding is that the vast majority of optical practices are now open during the amber phase, so this statement is not necessary in the current environment.

31. Do you agree with the content of this statement?
 Yes
 No

● The GOC gave up responsibility to Gareth Hadley (lay chair), the Chief Executive (Non-registrant) and David Parkins (Registrant chair) to make decisions and announcements regarding the current pandemic. - C17(20)Section 4.

● The guidance was heavily criticised and caused confusion amongst registrants.

● The guidance to follow the direction of the professional bodies was not in the best interests of the public and should have been the responsibility of the GOC to gather feedback and approve messages if they wanted the support of these bodies.

● They gave advice that caused registrants to breach the opticians act.

● They permitted companies to supply contact lenses without having a registrant in their employment. Their guidance suggested that these companies verify the prescriptions. However without a registrant present, they cannot be adequately verified and quality and safety cannot be ensured

● Prior to this guidance being given, they consulted with Vision Express executives on at least two occasions. Lesley Longstone and Marcus Dye together on one occasion and Marcus Dye alone on the other. The appropriate body, the BCLA, does not appear to have been consulted.

● “The Director of Strategy (Interim) and I (Lesley Longstone) had a call with Onur Koksal, Dan McGhee and Nick Coton of Vision Express regarding flexibility in relation to verification of contact lens prescriptions. Our process for considering new flexibilities was explained and I agreed to consider their request alongside others currently being examined.” - C16(20) Section 50.

● Gareth Hadley ‘had informal bilateral conversations with the professional services directors of three largest corporate community optical providers, namely registrant optometrist Paul Carroll (Specsavers Optical Group), registrant optometrist Dan McGhee (Vision Express), and registrant
optometrist Claire Slade (Boots Opticians). - C17(20) Section 12.

Sale and supply of contact lenses
In ‘General Optical Council (GOC) statement on verification of contact lens specifications during COVID-19 emergency’, 16 April 2020, it says: (4) ... This will also ensure that patients are able to obtain contact lenses through businesses operating within UK law (regardless of whether they are
registered with the GOC)

This is in contravention of the 1989 Opticians Act Section 27:
(1)A person shall not sell:- (a) any contact lens for use by any person who does not have a valid specification provided pursuant to section 25(5) above; or (b) subject to the following provisions of this section, any optical appliance or zero powered contact lens unless the sale is effected by or under the supervision of a registered medical practitioner, a registered optometrist or a
registered dispensing optician. (3) Those requirements are that:- ….(d) the seller is, or is under the general direction of, a registered medical practitioner, a registered optometrist or a
registered dispensing optician;
It also contradicts the GOC’s previous statement in 2006 in which they clarified their interpretation of the act in regard to the sale and supply of optical appliances. At the time they said:
The GOC considers that the rules in relation to the requirements for a written specification and its verification are clear. Where there is evidence to suggest that the requirements of s27(3) are not being complied with, formal action may be taken.

The GOC’s claim to permit this change comes from a joint regulatory statement from
the Chief Executives of the Healthcare regulators which suggests that the standards
be made flexible.

There are many cases of complications arising as a result of contact lens wear; one of those being Acanthamoeba Keratitis which is sight threatening. The British Contact Lens Association (BCLA)says:

Another risk factor is buying contact lenses over the internet, which may be related to contact lens care attitudes and behaviours. Wearers who buy lenses from sources other than their eye care practitioner have been shown to be less likely to follow good eyecare health practices, including being less likely to attend regular aftercare check-ups.

THIS PART IS NOW OUTDATED AND SHOULD INCLUDE THE AIO STEPPING IN.

The GOC has more recently given guidance for registrants to reopen businesses to private patients and not to NHS patients. This is in line with advice from the Association of Optometrists but contrary to the advice of the College of Optometrists.
The designation of a patients’ status being covered or not covered under National Health Care is no matter for a body responsible for regulating optical professionals. We believe that withholding services to patients based on whether or not they meet the criteria for an NHS funded examination is irresponsible, dangerous and does not protect the public. We are also under the suspicion that this decision is related to the recent announcement to freeze an increase in GOS fees and that the intentions of the GOC in abetting others reflect the interests of its members rather than the interests of the public.

Also have these quotes which can be used to demonstrate the commercial pressures on the sector which the GOC are succumbing to:

The 2018 Optometrists Futures Survey:
There is a tension between the business imperative and helping clients in optometry Commercial/sales pressure is too high and is increasing

Many optometrists believed that there is a large, and increasing, commercial
focus to the role which has resulted in a decrease in emphasis on
patient-centred care

These bits are from the first social media campaign and might be a repeat of what's above.
Gareth Hadley is the chair for the GOC. He is not a registrant.
Lesley Longstone is the Chief Executive and Registrar. She is not a registrant.
David Parkins is a council member for the GOC. He is a registrant

THE BELOW SECTION IS FROM A PUBLIC STATEMENT I MADE PERSONALLY. MARCUS DYE RESPONDED.

Section 1. The Dangers of Being Vague
The General Optical Council (GOC), General Medical Council (GMC) and all other regulatory bodies pursue their ‘over-arching objective’ in ensuring ‘the protection of the public’, as established by their respective acts (Opticians Act 1989 c. 44) (Medical Act 1983 c.54)
It is the GOC’s duty to protect, promote and maintain the health, safety and wellbeing of the public. However, I find the statements provided by the GOC, regarding the COVID-19 outbreak to be vague, at times dangerous and seeks to put the burden of responsibility solely on registrants instead of themselves. As it is the GOC’s duty to protect the public, I feel the GOC are responsible for any inadequate decisions made by registrants who unknowingly work outside their level of competence and the GOC should be held accountable for any decisions made that result in patients becoming infected. It would be outside of a registrants’ competence to apply judgement in this situation on what is in the best interest of patients without clear guidance from the GOC because preventing the
spread of viruses is not a competency for registrants. The General Medical Council and General Dental Council both set standards to ensure that the public is protected from risks posed by the health of registrants and professionals. [1] [2] within medicine are provided training specific to pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing. I applaud the College of Optometrists decision to call for all registrants to ‘offer only essential eyecare’ and the AOP’s guidance to ‘postpone routine appointments’, but feel [3] that this message should have been delivered and enforced by the GOC. The GOC did announce its support for registrants who decide to follow the advice of these organisations [4] by only offering essential services but have yet to provide any advice of their own to ensure public safety. Because it is not currently enforced, stores like Specsavers Stevenage are able to justify opening extra clinics for children during the outbreak , putting the public at risk

Unfortunately, practices are not vicariously liable under the GOC’s powers for their decisions and we often find that the decisions and pressures applied by some businesses can result in the registrant being held accountable. We need to see a change to ensure businesses can be held accountable and whilst I support the GOCs future goal of legislative reform of business regulation, I lack confidence in their capacity and ability to enforce business standards. This also sets up the GOC to conduct practice assessments for those undertaking Optometry Degree Apprentices and I hope that such adaptations to their strategic plan are not there to allow an apprenticeship that has no benefit for the profession, comprises patient safety and allows training to be undertaken by corporate bodies. Many are reassured that the GOC will not allow the Institute for Apprenticeships to permit corporations from becoming End Point Assessors for this apprenticeship, but in light of the current situation and the GOCs reliance on NHS England to be able to tell it's registrants what to do, I am not reassured in the slightest.

I also highlight the issue that the GOC has not clearly defined what ‘essential’ means in terms of ‘essential eye services’ [4] It could argue that all examinations are essential or that only sight threatening conditions are essential. Perhaps consider a patient with glaucoma losing their sight because they were not deemed essential due to historically having pressures under control. Who is responsible for the lack of care? Would the GOC support the registrants decision? If the registrant was held accountable, would the GOC not then be responsible for holding all registrants that incorrectly applied professional judgement during this time? I ask these questions to highlight the issues with the published guidance and hope further clarification will be issued as soon as possible

In relation to contact lens aftercare, the GOC stated: “Neither the GOC nor legislation limits the way in which aftercare might be provided”. They then go on to suggest that an aftercare could be delivered remotely via telephone or video conference. To suggest that this constitutes an aftercare and to suggest that neither the GOC nor legislation prevents practices from performing such tasks routinely demonstrates the GOCs inability to reduce the risk to the public or to their registrants. I do not agree that what constitutes a contact lens aftercare cannot be defined as it is laid out in the ‘Contact Lens Speciality Competency’ as set out by the GOC.



12.It states that a competent contact lens optician:
‘Uses a slit-lamp to assess the external eye and related structures’
‘Measures external dimensions relevant to contact lens fittings’
‘Assesses the tear film’

13. This suggests that only an incompetent professional would perform an aftercare via
telephone or video conference. I believe that this simple definition of competence would not
have been so easily overlooked by a competent regulator.
Source: 13 Contact Lens Speciality Competency: 3.2.2, 3.2.3 and 3.2.4



They did not address the contact lens issue in their response.
